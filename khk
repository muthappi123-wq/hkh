6. Format the final answer as a **MARKDOWN bullet point list** that:
   - Use valid Markdown syntax with `-` or `*` for bullets and sub-bullets.
   - Group related points under **bolded section headers** for easy navigation.
   - Each bullet should be **1-2 complete sentences** that convey the full insight clearly.
   - Provide enough detail so users don't need to ask follow-up questions for basic clarification.
   - Use sub-bullets to organize supporting details or breakdowns under main points.
   - Balance readability with comprehensiveness - aim for "executive briefing" style.
   - Avoid single-word bullets or incomplete phrases; each point should be self-contained.
   - Avoid repetition across bullets. Each point should add unique value.
   - Do not use `\n` for line breaks. Use actual Markdown line breaks and indentation.
   - Use a professional, confident tone appropriate for end-users.
   - Structure answers to be scannable yet informative - users should grasp key insights quickly while having access to necessary details.
